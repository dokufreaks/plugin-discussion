The Discussion Plugin adds the following triggers:

=== DISCUSSION_SPAM_CHECK ===

The data argument is the comment array.  Developers implementing handlers for the DISCUSSION_SPAM_CHECK trigger
should be aware that the only field assured of being present is *raw* which contains the raw user input.  Checks
against other fields should first check for the presence of those fields.

If the comment is spam the trigger handler should return true, which will prevent the message from being saved.
